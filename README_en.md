# XYZ — pyRevit extension for MEP designers

🇷🇺 [Русская версия](README.md)

📢 **Telegram:** [@xyz_for_revit](https://t.me/xyz_for_revit) — news, tips and button demos

![XYZ](docs/img/icons_bg/XYZ.png)

MEP tools for Revit: tags, schematics, plenum families, fabrication sketches, schedules and sheet export. So that Revit routine doesn't spoil your mood, use XYZ.

> [!NOTE]
> XYZ adds its own **XYZ** tab to the Revit ribbon. Panels: **Inspect** (find and select) · **Model** · **Explode** (exploded views) · **Annotate** · **Publish** · **Exchange** (Excel).
> Button titles and tooltips are available in English and Russian; pyRevit shows them in its own UI language. Command windows and the detailed button docs (`docs/Кнопки`) are in Russian for now.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tested only on **Revit 2025.4** with **pyRevit 6.1.0**. Other Revit and pyRevit versions have not been tested.

**1. pyRevit 6.1.0.** Close Revit, download and run the installer:
- [pyRevit_6.1.0.26047_signed.exe](https://github.com/pyrevitlabs/pyRevit/releases/download/v6.1.0.26047%2B2255/pyRevit_6.1.0.26047_signed.exe) — regular per-user install;
- all files of this version — on the [6.1.0 release page](https://github.com/pyrevitlabs/pyRevit/releases/tag/v6.1.0.26047%2B2255).

Start Revit — the **pyRevit** tab appears on the ribbon.

**2. XYZ — from pyRevit.**
1. In Revit, on the **pyRevit** tab, click **Extensions** — the pyRevit Extensions Manager opens.
2. In the list of registered extensions, select **XYZ** and click **Install Extension**.
3. pyRevit downloads the extension and reloads itself — the **XYZ** tab appears.

> [!NOTE]
> If you installed XYZ manually before, close Revit and delete the old folder `%APPDATA%\pyRevit\Extensions\XYZ.extension` first.

**Fallback — manually:** at the top of this page **Code → Download ZIP**, unpack it into `%APPDATA%\pyRevit\Extensions\`, rename the folder `XYZ-main` to `XYZ.extension`, then pyRevit → **Reload**.

**3. Tab position.** The **XYZ** tab appears at the end of the ribbon. To place it right after **Insert**, set `"tab_after_insert": true` in `%APPDATA%\pyRevit\xyz_settings.json` and Reload.

**4. Vector PDF (optional).** PDF optimisation runs in a separate Python 3 ([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)) with:
```
py -m pip install --user pikepdf shapely numpy
```
Without them, sheets are exported by Revit as is, without optimisation.

**Update:** pyRevit → **Update** — pyRevit downloads new versions of installed extensions (including XYZ) and reloads itself. If you installed manually, download the ZIP again and replace the folder, then Reload.

> [!WARNING]
> The tools were written for specific projects and templates (ADSK shared parameters and our own `db_*` parameters). Before bulk changes — do a trial run and save the model.

| ![](docs/img/icons_bg/Под%20копирку.png) | Exchange | Copy Format | schedule formatting → other schedules with the same columns; Shift+click — column widths only |

## General rules
- **XYZ panel on the «Modify | …» tab:** when something is selected, Identify, Which Filter, Filter by Type, Tag Tools and MEP Align are also available on Revit's contextual tab.
- **Every command:** where (selection / view / model) → what (options) → before/after preview → Apply / Cancel → report. One command = one transaction, undo with **Ctrl+Z**.
- View graphics are changed with **view filters** only, never with per-element overrides.
- No network access, no bundled binaries. The model-change updater for elevation marks is off by default (`elev_marks_auto` in `xyz_settings.json`).
